                  <p>Condo Insurance has its own unique insurance needs. Typically, the master policy held by the Condo Association provides coverage for the exterior structure, pool, hallways, common grounds and shared amenities. Condo owners need a separate insurance policy for their unit. This policy would provide coverage for your personal property, improvements, interiors walls including fixtures, flooring, cabinets, and lighting. You will also have liability coverage for bodily injury or property damage to others. </p>

                                You like the lifestyle and the freedom to live in your space without the baggage of maintenance, grounds care etc. Your home is still likely your largest investment. Is it well protected? Will you have enough coverage if it is destroyed by fire, lightning, tornado, or man-made events such as burglary, vandalism, arson? Homeowners policies have been sold in the US since the 1950's and today are in very common use throughout the country.<br><br>

Specific versions of homeowners policies have been developed for the unique coverage needs of the condo owner:<br><br>

Just as a homeowners policy has specific coverages necessary to protect their interests, a condominium policy does too. For example, a condo policy typically covers certain types of property: alterations, appliances, fixtures and improvements that are not part of the building, but contained in your unit."

                                All the goods and furniture in your home constitute contents. But all policies are not alike and some contents are limited in specific value due to the nature of the item or use. For example, business property is often limited to a specific dollar amount. Remember that replacement of your contents requires replacement coverage; otherwise you will only be afforded Actual Cash Value (ACV). Let an independent agent compare your existing coverage with other programs and give you expert advice on how best to meet your insurance needs. When insuring high value items such as jewelry, watches, and furs, be sure to ask your agent about special policy limitations for these types of property.

                                Accidents happen at home... and when your guest is injured due to your negligence, the condo homeowner liability section responds. Also, in a condo you are generally in closer proximity to your neighbors than in a single-family structure. With that comes great propensity to cause injury or damages to your neighbors. Imagine, every day you walk your dog and provide adequate food and shelter. As you come or go from your unit, your dog inexplicably lunges at another unit owner and bites causing injury to that person. That is a type of event your Personal Liability Coverage under a condo owner's policy responds to.

                                No discussion of condo owner's responsibilities would be complete without some discussion of assessments. In general, you share common areas with other unit owners and have common interest in the facilities working well for all owners. However, things can happen in common areas that give rise to assessments even more so than in a traditional homeowner association. For example, a water pipe runs through common areas of the building's attic, but is not protected well enough to prevent freezing and bursting. Naturally, the water of course flows downward and into a particular unit that is heavily damaged. It was not your unit, but the damage was caused from the common areas maintenance or lack of maintenance. The result is that Condo Unit Owners Association assess all owners for the damages. If you have not anticipated this possibility it can come as an unpleasant surprise. Talk with your independent agent and be sure you have adequate loss assessment coverage to protect you and your family.

Identity Recovery Protection<br><br>

You go out for dinner and your credit card is declined. You call your credit card company to inquire and they have told you they froze your account as you have exceeded the spending limit. You feel a knot in your stomach as you find out what has happened, someone has hacked and stolen your identity and made unauthorized purchases on your account. While your credit card company may pay for the fraudulent purchases, it is up to you to clear your name to be absolved. This is not simple. Per FTC statistic reports, 10% of victims spent 55 hours resolving their problems and 10% reported out-of-pocket expenses of $1,200 or more.<br><br>

When you add Identity Recovery Protection coverage, the following services are provided:<br><br>
• Service Support Help Line<br>
• Case Management<br>
• Insurance Support Coverage<br><br>

Refer to your policy for limits.<br><br>
