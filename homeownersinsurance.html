                  <p>Homeowners insurance is a package policy. This means that it covers both damage to your property and your liability or legal responsibility for any injuries and property damage you or members of your family cause to other people. This includes damage caused by household pets. </p>
                  <p>Damage caused by most disasters is covered but there are exceptions. The most significant are damage caused by floods, earthquakes and poor maintenance. Earthquake Coverage is offered by Houston General Insurance but you must buy a separate policy for flood coverage. Maintenance-related problems are the homeowners' responsibility.

                                Typically, your home is your largest investment. Is it well protected? Will you have enough coverage if it is destroyed by fire, lightning, tornado, or man-made events such as burglary, vandalism or arson? Homeowners policies have been sold in the United States since the 1950's and today are in very common use throughout the country.<br><br>

								A homeowner policy usually has several separate coverages. Click on each tab to learn more.

                                This portion of a homeowner policy covers the structure itself. It is most important that you cover your house with enough coverage to replace it if it were totally destroyed. Remember that rebuilding one house is different than building a subdivision for the first time. For example, the reconstruction effort after a fire usually starts with the debris removal. Sometimes access to the property is now much more difficult than when originally built.<br><br>

								Therefore, let an independent agent help you determine what the correct value of your home is for replacement coverage. There is enough difficulty in starting over after a catastrophic loss such as a tornado for example, but do not make matters worse by having an inadequate replacement cost coverage amount of insurance.

                                All the goods and furniture in your home constitute contents. But all policies are not alike and some contents are limited in specific value due to the nature of the item or use. For example, business property is often limited to a specific dollar amount. Remember that replacement of your contents requires replacement coverage; otherwise you will only be afforded Actual Cash Value (ACV), which is the replacement cost of the item minus depreciation.<br><br>

								Let an independent agent compare your existing coverage with other programs and give you expert advice on how best to meet your needs. When insuring high value items such as jewelry watches and furs, be sure to ask your agent about special policy limitations for these types of property.

                                Accidents happen at home and when your guest is injured due to your negligence, the homeowner liability section responds. For example, a neighbor is invited over and trips over the garden hose you left out. This is an event that your liability coverage provides coverage for.<br><br>

								Likewise, liability can extend away from your premises as well for activities you or family members are involved with. An important part of the liability protection is defending you from lawsuits for incidents taking place on your premise. Defense costs themselves can be significant and are included in your homeowner protection.

                                Water Sewer Back-up<br><br>

								With so many benefits of being a homeowner, there are also many responsibilities. Did you know that as a homeowner you are not only responsible for the maintenance and repair of your home, but also of the sewer lines extending from your home to the city or county’s main sewer line as well?<br><br>

								There are many causes of sewer backups such as blockage from tree roots or malfunction from the Sump Pump causing a water backup which may overflow your toilets causing damage to your home.<br><br>

								These damages can be extensive and very costly. How would you pay for the repairs to your home and it’s contents? Water sewer backup is excluded on your policy but for an additional premium you can purchase this coverage to assist you in the restoration of your home and it’s contents.<br><br>


								Scheduled Personal Property<br><br>

								While Personal Property covers your personal property from a covered loss, there are limitations to certain property. Whether you have an art or gun collection, or perhaps you want to insure that sentimental engagement ring, we offer both scheduled and unscheduled coverage for your valuables. Be sure to ask your agent about special policy limitations for these types of property and increase where desired for that peace of mind.

Personal Property Coverage is available such as health monitoring systems, home exercise equipment, computers, tablets, laptops, and lawn equipment.<br><br>

								Service Line Protection<br><br>

								Many homeowners are not aware that they are responsible for the maintenance and repair of the underground outdoor water and sewer piping from their house to the street. The cost of replacing and repairing can be very costly. Most insurance do not cover these damages but may offer Water Sewer Backup Endorsement to their policy, but this limited endorsement does not cover the replacement of the pipeline itself. This Service Line Protection coverage closes this gap.<br><br>

								This Service Line Endorsement covers the following:<br><br>
								• Physical Damage, Excavation Costs<br>
								• Expediting Expenses<br>

								Identity Recovery Protection<br><br>

								You go out for dinner and your credit card is declined. You call your credit card company to inquire and they have told you they froze your account as you have exceeded the spending limit. You feel a knot in your stomach as you find out what has happened, someone has hacked and stolen your identity and made unauthorized purchases on your account. While your credit card company may pay for the fraudulent purchases, it is up to you to clear your name to be absolved. This is not simple. Per FTC statistic reports, 10% of victims spent 55 hours resolving their problems and 10% reported out-of-pocket expenses of $1,200 or more.<br><br>

								When you add Identity Recovery Protection coverage, the following services are provided:<br><br>
								• Service Support Help Line<br>
								• Case Management<br>
								• Insurance Support Coverage<br><br>

								Refer to your policy for limits.<br><br>
